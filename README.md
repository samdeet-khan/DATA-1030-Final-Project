# DATA-1030-Final-Project
This project explores the relationship between criteria available within job postings and expected average salary outcomes. This is a foundational data science project that allowed me to explore various EDA techniques and effective linear and nonlinear ML algorithms in the context of a regression problem. 

The "data1030.yml" file will set up the following environment: 
- Python Version 3.11.7
- numpy version 1.24.4 
- matplotlib version 3.7.2
- sklearn version 1.3.0
- pandas version 2.0.3
- xgboost version 1.7.6
- shap version 0.42.1
- seaborn version 0.12.2

The datasets used in this project are from Kaggle, where the author posted the datasets after scraping relevant data from LinkedIn job postings in October 2023. They can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/
